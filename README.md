## Vue.js App Features:

✅ **Same functionality as React app**
✅ **User-specific ticket data** (no sharing between users)
✅ **Proper authentication with localStorage**
✅ **CRUD operations with validation**
✅ **Responsive design with same styling**
✅ **Toast notifications**
✅ **Protected routes**
✅ **Clean component structure**

The Vue.js app now has all the same features as the React app, including the user-specific data isolation we implemented. Each user will see only their own tickets, and new users start with empty dashboards.

You can now test the application by running `npm run dev` and verifying that:
1. New users start with empty dashboards
2. Tickets are tied to the user who created them
3. Logging out and signing in with different accounts shows isolated data
4. All CRUD operations work correctly
5. The styling matches the React version exactly
